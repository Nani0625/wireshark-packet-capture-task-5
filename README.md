Wireshark Packet Capture Analysis
Task Overview

This project demonstrates basic packet capture, protocol analysis, and network troubleshooting using Wireshark. The goal is to capture live network traffic, identify protocols, and summarize key findings as per the internship task guidelines.

​
Steps Performed

    Wireshark Installation

        Installed via:

        bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install wireshark

    Packet Capture

        Started Wireshark and selected the active network interface (typically wlan0 or eth0).

        Began packet capturing and generated network traffic by browsing websites and running ping commands.

    Capture Filtering

        Used protocol filters:

            HTTP: http

            DNS: dns

            TCP: tcp

        Identified at least three protocols within the traffic.

    Export

        Saved the capture as network_capture.pcap.

    Analysis & Reporting

        Summarized protocols and notable packet details.

        Answered key interview questions (see below).

Protocols Identified

    TCP: Reliable connection protocol used in web browsing and connections.

    DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

    ICMP: Used for ping and network diagnostics.

    (Add more if observed, e.g., HTTP, UDP, ARP)

Notable Packet Details
No.	      Protocol	      Source IP	        Destination IP	Info
1	TCP	    192.168.1.X	    8.8.8.8	          SYN packet (connection start)
2	DNS	    192.168.1.X	    8.8.8.8	          Query: google.com
3	ICMP	  192.168.1.X	    142.250.185.46	  Echo request (ping)
